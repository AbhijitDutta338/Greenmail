Problem Statement:
DIGITAL WASTE PROBLEM STATEMENT – SCENARIO 1
REDUCE CARBON FOOTPRINTS PRODUCED BY EMAILS. AS PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM STATEMENT,
1) CREATE A MOCK EMAIL SERVER
2) CREATE AN ALGORITHM TO MONITORING AND ANALYSE THE INCOMING/OUTGOING EMAILS. RAISE A FLAG FOR
THE USER TO SHIFT THE BEHAVIOUR THAT WILL HELP IN REDUCING THE CARBON FOOTPRINTS GENERATED
THROUGH EMAILS.

Solution Idea:
The solution revolves around the idea of trying to shift user behaviour by making him more informed and aware.
Presenting, GREENMAIL an eco-friendly emailing application where users can register with any of their email accounts like gmail, yahoo, etc. It monitors the outgoing mails of registered users and tracks the carbon footprint of them via a third-party API – “Climatiq REST API”. It gives users the statistics of carbon footprint produced by their emails and gives cues to shift their behaviour to the best practises that reduces carbon footprint generated through emails.

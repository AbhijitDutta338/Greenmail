## Problem Statement:
### DIGITAL WASTE PROBLEM STATEMENT – SCENARIO 1
REDUCE CARBON FOOTPRINTS PRODUCED BY EMAILS. AS PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM STATEMENT,
1) CREATE A MOCK EMAIL SERVER
2) CREATE AN ALGORITHM TO MONITORING AND ANALYSE THE INCOMING/OUTGOING EMAILS. RAISE A FLAG FOR
THE USER TO SHIFT THE BEHAVIOUR THAT WILL HELP IN REDUCING THE CARBON FOOTPRINTS GENERATED
THROUGH EMAILS.

## Solution Idea:
The solution revolves around the idea of trying to shift user behaviour by making him more informed and aware.
Presenting, GREENMAIL an eco-friendly emailing application where users can register with any of their email accounts like gmail, yahoo, etc. It monitors the outgoing mails of registered users and tracks the carbon footprint of them via a third-party API – “Climatiq REST API”. It gives users the statistics of carbon footprint produced by their emails and gives cues to shift their behaviour to the best practises that reduces carbon footprint generated through emails.

## Algorithm (Solution methodology):
As per the problem statement, we have categorized emails in 3 different categories that have different impact on the levels of carbon footprint generated by them.
1. Emails with attachments (avg. CO2e per mail = 50g)
2. Promotional/Spam Emails (avg. CO2e per mail = 0.3g, but has the highest frequency)
3. Normal Email (avg. CO2e per mail = 4g)

The application tries to shift the user behaviour for all 3 types of email. The solution provided for each mail type is listed as follows:
1. Emails with attachments: The application actively discourages users from attaching files with their email and requests them to replace attachments with any cloud links where the recipient can download the required files. A modal is shown with the harmful effects of attachments in mails and requests the user to shift to cloud links.

2. Promotional/Spam Emails: The application keeps track of the promotional emails sent to user. It quantifies the engagement of the user with the promotional/spam mails and allows the user to see a list – “#TheCorrectList” with the top unengaged mailing list where he is receiving mails from. The user can then click on the username of the promotional mailing address and he is shown all the mails he received sorted from newest to oldest from that mailing address where from he can view the mails and unsubscribe from the mailing lists.
𝐸𝑛𝑔𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡=(total mails from promotional mailer to user) – (total unread mails from promotional mailer to user)(total mails from promotional mailer to user)𝑥100

3. Normal Email: The application keeps track of the CO2e of the emails sent by the user via an external API – “Climatiq REST API”. The user is shown the amount of CO2e on each mail successfully sent. He is also shown the statistics of CO2e of himself and the average user in the profile page. These information’s are meant for the user to be informed of the impact of his actions.
Another modal which can be accessed from any mailing screen – “Good Habits”, inform the user of the best practises that he can incorporate in his mailing habits to reduce his impact.
